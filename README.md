# README

## Creating a repo off this template

- Click the green button in the top right, `Use this template`, and then `Create a new repository`.
- From there, you can fill in the details.
- To edit the repo further, you either:
  - work on it locally after cloning the repo (`git clone https://github.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>`), or
  - work on it remotely in a pre-configured `R` environment using a GitHub codespace.
    - To use it as a GitHub codespace, on the repo homepage click the green `<> Code` button and then the green `Create codespace on main` button.
    - Note that you have 30 hours per month free by default in GitHub codespaces, but 45 hours free if you have GitHub Pro.
    - You can get GitHub Pro for free by getting the GitHub Student Developer pack, which you can sign up for [here](https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student).
    - Small note: you need to `R` terminal. In an open terminal (`Ctrl + Shift + \backtick` if there is not one), type `radian` (to get a better `R` terminal, somewhat like the `RStudio` terminal) or `R` (to get the awful, standard `R` terminal).

## Template structure

All written work (with exception of presentation slides) should be reproducible, and the GitHub repo should be neatly organized.

The GitHub repo should have the following structure:

- `README`: Short project description and data dictionary
- `written-report.qmd` & `written-report.pdf`: Final written report
- `data/`: Folder that contains the data set for the final project.
- `previous-work`: Folder that contains the topic-ideas and project-proposal files.
- `presentation`: Folder with the presentation slides.
  - If your presentation slides are online, you can put a link to the slides in a README.md file in the presentation folder.
    - GitHub can host one for free via GitHub Pages. Google for details.

Points for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written report and the organization of the project GitHub repo.
The repo should be neatly organized as described above, there should be no extraneous files, all text in the README should be easily readable.
